<p>Proof of Stake Explained: A Secure and Sustainable Future for Web3
In Brief
Discover Proof of Stake, how it differs from Proof of Work and how it powers security and sustainability in Web3.
Understanding Proof of Stake: Putting Crypto to Work
Proof of Stake functions as a democratic system where the right to vote is proportional to your stake in the community. Here's how Proof of Stake works:

Staking: Users lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency holdings in a process called staking. This staked crypto acts as collateral, demonstrating their commitment to the network's security.

Validators: Not everyone gets to directly validate transactions. The network selects validators based on the amount of crypto they've staked. The more crypto staked, the higher the chance of being chosen.

Block validation: Chosen validators propose new blocks containing batches of verified transactions. Other validators then scrutinize these proposed blocks to ensure their accuracy.

Rewards and penalties: Validators who propose and validate valid blocks are rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. Conversely, those who propose or validate invalid blocks face penalties, including the potential loss of a portion of their stake.

Proof of Stake incentivizes honest participation. Validators have a vested interest in maintaining the network's integrity. The more crypto they stake, the more they stand to gain (or lose) depending on their actions.</p>
